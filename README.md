## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

- Located in the `/frontend` directory
- Uses `fetch()` to call backend API
- Features:
  - Add new users
  - View all users
  - Search by ID
  - Delete users
- Automatically refreshes the user list after changes

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/users-backend.git
cd users-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_db_connection_string
PORT=8080
```
> Replace `your_neon_db_connection_string` with the actual connection string from your  [NeonDB Dashboard](https://neon.tech).

---

## üîß 4. Running the App

```bash
npm start
```

- The backend runs on: http://localhost:8080

- It auto-creates the users table on startup

---

## üåê Access the Frontend

- Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:8080
```

You‚Äôll see a form to add users and a list of users below it.

---

## üîå REST API Reference

All routes are prefixed with `/api/users`


| Method | Endpoint       | Description           |
|--------|----------------|-----------------------|
| GET    | /              | Get all users         |
| POST   | /              | Create a new user     |
| GET    | /:id           | Get single user by ID |
| PUT    | /:id           | Update user by ID     |
| DELETE | /:id           | Delete user by ID     |

---

## üì® Sample POST Request

**POST** `/api/users`

Use the following JSON structure to create a new user:

```json
{
  "name": "Aditya",
  "email": "tulsyanaditya03@gmail.com",
  "age": 21
}
```

---

## üõ¢Ô∏è Database Integration

This project uses **NeonDB (PostgreSQL)** as its database. Integration is done via the official [`pg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) client.

- `db.js` handles connection pooling and table creation.
- SQL queries are written directly in `userController.js`.

The users table schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  age INT
);
```

---

## ‚úÖ API Testing (curl)

```bash
# Create User
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Aditya","email":"tulsyanaditya03@gmail.com","age":21}'

# Get All Users
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Get User by ID
curl http://localhost:8080/1

# Update User
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"Aditya","email":"tulsyanaditya03@gmail.com","age":21}'

# Delete User
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/1
```
